            John Z. DeLorean grew up impoverished during the depression and went on to become one of the most successful
            men of his time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Though he did not have a private school education, he was still able to find a pathway to his passion and
            provide the world with innovations that not only changed automotive history but impacted car culture forever
          </p>

          <p>
            Great minds like my fathers could be left behind not only due to lack of access to education, but lack of
            opportunity or support to succeed.
          </p>

          <p>
            If we can provide more individuals with education and opportunities, the law of averages dictates, we will
            foster more innovation and exceptionality. By driving education through commerce of automobiles, we can
            truly drive the future leaving no child behind.
